            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">EState governments and local government bodies manage the majority of
                primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing.
                Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of
                schools offering elementary education (Grades 1-8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were
                under private management (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the
                Education Guarantee Scheme and in alternative learning centers).At the primary and secondary level,
                India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students
                receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[14] Certain post-secondary technical schools are
                also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is
                projected to be a US$40 billion market.[ Of those schools managed privately, one third are 'aided' and
                two thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1-8 is shared between government and privately managed
                schools in the ratio 73:27.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of teacher
                absenteeism may have encouraged the rapid growth of private (unaided) schooling in India, particularly
                in urban areas. Private schools divide into two types: recognised and unrecognised schools. Government
                'recognition' is an official stamp of approval and for this a private school is required to fulfil a
                number of conditions, though hardly any private schools that get 'recognition' actually fulfil all the
                conditions of recognition. The emergence of large numbers of unrecognised primary schools suggests that
                schools and parents do not take government recognition as a stamp of quality At the primary and
                secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, with
                29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[14] Certain post-secondary
                technical schools are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450
